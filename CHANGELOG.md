# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.16.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- **`bigin-harness-setup`:** scaffolded repos now surface the Claude Code workspace-trust step, which was previously undocumented and caused the `.claude/settings.json` `permissions.allow` entries to be silently ignored on first run in a new/moved workspace. Phase 6's `## AI Onboarding` README block adds a step to accept the trust dialog (or set `hasTrustDialogAccepted` in `~/.claude.json` for headless setups); Phase 7's summary calls it out as next step 1.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **`sprint-distill` skill:** new standalone skill (`skills/sprint-distill/`) that replaces a manual NotebookLM end-of-sprint pass with a git-native distillation step: merged PRs + `knowledge/log.md` cursor → sprint-distill → `knowledge/` + `bigin-skills` updates → knowledge validator gate. Determines sprint scope from the last `knowledge/log.md` entry (asks for a start date if undeterminable, or falls back to a skills-only mode if the repo has no Knowledge Bundle at all). Gathers merged PRs, touched concept files, current `.claude/rules/`, and any pasted out-of-repo material. Classifies every candidate with a strict sorting rule — WHAT/WHY → `knowledge/`, HOW-we-work → `bigin-skills`, neither → dropped and reported, never both, link don't copy — then proposes the full change set and **stops for approval** before writing anything. On approval: applies changes, runs `tools/knowledge_validate.py` best-effort (never blocks on missing tooling), appends the log entry last. First-class stale-concept detection (diff-touched resources whose concept file wasn't updated; index-unreachable concepts). Explicitly does not trigger on single-PR/single-change review — that stays `/code-review`.
- **`bigin-harness-setup` wiring:** Phase 5.5 step 5's conditional CLAUDE.md append (when `KNOWLEDGE_BUNDLE = true`) now also points at `sprint-distill`; Phase 7's summary notes its availability under the same condition.

## [1.15.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

`nuxt-scaffold` no longer inherits a stale `create-nuxt@3.36.1` template snapshot, and 10 real bugs (all found and confirmed via actual end-to-end scaffold runs, not just review) are fixed:

- **Dependency freshness:** new Stage 1b re-pins `nuxt`, `@nuxt/ui`, `@nuxt/eslint`, `eslint`, `tailwindcss`, `vue-tsc`, `typescript`, `@pinia/nuxt`, `nuxt-auth-utils`, `@vueuse/nuxt` to current releases right after init, per a new `VERSION_POLICY` choice in Phase 2 (`capped` — stay on the currently-installed major, default; `latest` — allow a future major). Fixes scaffolds silently shipping on Tailwind/Nuxt UI releases old enough to predate current features (e.g. Tailwind's `mauve`/`olive`/`mist`/`taupe` neutral palettes, now listed as Phase 2 options).
- Rewrote the refresh step as a single `node -e` script using `execFileSync` with an argument array — the previous shell `for` loop relied on word-splitting zsh doesn't do by default, and plain `require('<pkg>/package.json')` throws on packages with a restrictive `exports` map.
- Removed the stale `compatibilityVersion: 4` key from the `nuxt.config.ts` merge template — a Nuxt 3→4 migration opt-in flag that current Nuxt versions reject and strip; scaffolds already install Nuxt 4 directly.
- Fixed the `nuxt.config.ts` `runtimeConfig` merge to respect `nuxt/nuxt-config-keys-order` and `@stylistic/no-multi-spaces` (correct key position, comment on its own line).
- Removed a stale `tsconfig.json` merge instruction that broke `pnpm type-check` (`TS6306`/`TS6310`) against the current solution-style config — `.nuxt/tsconfig.shared.json` already covers `shared/**/*` automatically.
- Added `happy-dom` to the preset install — `@nuxt/test-utils`'s `environment: 'nuxt'` fails without it.
- Documented and sequenced pnpm 10+'s build-script approval gate correctly: `pnpm add` for a gated package exits 1 with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` but still installs (non-fatal, expected) — `simple-git-hooks`, `better-sqlite3` (`@nuxt/content`), and `esbuild`/`workerd` (`wrangler`) each get an immediate, separate `pnpm approve-builds <pkg> || true` (naming a non-pending package fails the whole call if combined).
- `@nuxt/content`: pre-install and approve `better-sqlite3` before `nuxi module add content`, or the command hangs forever on a non-interactive prompt.
- `@nuxt/image`: dropped an ineffective "pre-install `sharp`" step (doesn't prevent `nuxi` from hitting its own gate on an internally-resolved `sharp` version) in favor of a mandatory post-hoc check that `'@nuxt/image'` actually landed in `nuxt.config.ts`'s `modules` array, plus a required `pnpm approve-builds sharp || true` — without it, every subsequent `pnpm` command fails, not just the registration.
- The `create-nuxt@3.36.1` template's `nuxt.config.ts` ships without a trailing newline on every scaffold (not just when `image` is chosen) — `@stylistic/eol-last` fails `pnpm lint` until it's fixed; the Stage 3 merge now ensures the file ends with `\n`.
- Corrected a false claim that `--gitInit` creates an initial commit — it only runs `git init`.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **CI config (`bigin-harness-setup` Phase 5.6, optional):** generates a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and/or a GitLab CI pipeline (`.gitlab-ci.yml`) that run the profile's lint + typecheck + test commands on push to `main` and on merge/pull requests. Asks `github/gitlab/both/no`. New `references/ci.md` holds the per-profile templates (nuxt/nodejs via pnpm, go via `actions/setup-go`/`golang` image + staticcheck).
- If the Knowledge Bundle convention (Phase 5.5) was also opted into, the generated CI file automatically gets a `uv run tools/knowledge_validate.py` step wired in — no manual follow-up needed. Phase 5.5's step 7 note now only applies to pre-existing, hand-written CI config this skill didn't generate.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **Knowledge Bundle convention (`bigin-harness-setup` Phase 5.5, optional):** an internal knowledge-management format inspired by Open Knowledge Format v0.1 (no OKF tooling dependency). Scaffolds `knowledge/` — one concept file per Markdown file, required `type` frontmatter (`Index`, `Contract`, `System`, `Domain`, `Table`, `Metric`, `Playbook`, `Constraint`, `Log`), bundle-relative linking, link-don't-copy pointing to sources of truth (`openapi.yaml`, `.claude/rules/`, source code). New `references/knowledge-bundle.md` holds the templates: `.claude/rules/knowledge.md` rule file, `knowledge/meta/knowledge-bundle-spec.md`, starter `knowledge/index.md` + `knowledge/contracts/openapi-contract.md` + `knowledge/constraints/agent-rules.md` + `knowledge/log.md`, and `tools/knowledge_validate.py` — a PEP 723 (`uv run`-compatible) validator that hard-fails on missing/invalid frontmatter, disallowed `type`, or broken bundle-relative links, and warns on missing description/tags or files unreachable from the index.
- When opted in, the validator is wired into the existing pre-commit gate, and one line each is appended to `CLAUDE.md` (pointer to `knowledge/index.md`) and `AI_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` (behavior-changing PR → concept file updated). CI wiring is never done automatically — the setup summary flags it if CI config is detected.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **`nuxt-scaffold` skill:** New standalone skill (`skills/nuxt-scaffold/`) that scaffolds a Nuxt 4 BFF app **from scratch** — non-interactive `npm create nuxt@latest` (`--template ui`, `--packageManager pnpm`, `--gitInit`, `--force`), then the BFF preset modules (`pinia`, `nuxt-auth-utils`, `@vueuse/nuxt`, `@pinia/colada`, `zod`, `vitest`, `@nuxt/test-utils`, `simple-git-hooks`, `lint-staged`, `openapi-typescript`), then config + sample BFF code (proxy route, Pinia store, `vitest.config.ts`, `openapi.yaml` stub). Optional module extras (`image`, `content`) and an opt-in Drizzle + Cloudflare D1 layer. No GitHub template clone. Usable standalone and invoked by `bigin-harness-setup` Phase 0.5.

### Changed

- **bigin-harness-setup — Phase 0.5 delegates to the `nuxt-scaffold` skill** instead of cloning `tammai/nuxt-fullstack-template` and embedding a scaffold skill into the target. No more SSH/clone dependency; the project starts from a clean `npm create nuxt` base with `--gitInit`.
- **Ownership split (prevents drift):** `bash-guard.py` + its `PreToolUse` hook remain governance (harness). `nuxt-scaffold` writes `.claude/settings.json` with only `permissions` + a `PostToolUse` lint-fix hook; the harness Phase 5-3 merges the `PreToolUse` bash-guard hook on top (preserving the scaffold's `PostToolUse`). `profile-nuxt.md`'s `## settings.json Template` is now documented as the governance superset (used when onboarding an existing nuxt repo).
- **Phase 2 (CLAUDE.md):** the SCAFFOLDED "append pointer to the template's CLAUDE.md" special-case is removed — the scaffold no longer ships a `CLAUDE.md`, so the harness writes it fresh.
- **profile-nuxt.md:** line 5 now points to the `nuxt-scaffold` skill; the stale "matches nuxt-fullstack-template" note updated.

### Removed

- **`references/scaffold-nuxt.md`** (clone-based embedded scaffold) — superseded by the standalone `nuxt-scaffold` skill. The `git clone tammai/nuxt-fullstack-template` step is gone from the scaffold flow.

---

## [1.12.2] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- **nuxt scaffold — reset git history after clone:** Step 3 now removes `.git` and runs `git init` after copying the template files. The project starts with a clean repo with no template history.

---

## [1.12.1] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- **nuxt scaffold — remove all Wrangler references:** `wrangler.toml` is now deleted during scaffold (Step 4) — it's not used by the BFF layer. Removed the `wrangler.toml name` customization step that referenced it.
- **nuxt scaffold — ask for customization inputs upfront:** new Step 2 collects project name and theme (primary/neutral colors) before cloning, shows a summary, and asks the user to confirm before proceeding. Previously customization happened inline during Step 3 without a consolidated prompt.

---

## [1.12.0] - 2026-06-30

### Changed

- **bigin-harness-setup — Nuxt scaffold generates a project skill instead of depending on local skills:** Phase 0.5 no longer relies on the locally-installed `nuxt-fullstack-scaffold` skill or any local template codebase. Instead it:
  1. Generates `.claude/skills/nuxt-scaffold/SKILL.md` in the target project (self-contained skill, no external dependencies) from `references/scaffold-nuxt.md`.
  2. Immediately executes that skill's steps to scaffold the Nuxt app.
  The generated skill is preserved in the project so teammates can re-run it without needing `bigin-skills` installed. Idempotent: skill file is skipped if it already exists.
- **`references/scaffold-nuxt.md`** restructured as a SKILL.md template (frontmatter + steps) rather than a prose reference. Removed the cross-reference to `nuxt-fullstack-scaffold` skill.

---

## [1.11.0] - 2026-06-30

### Changed

- **nuxt profile — remove D1/KV/R2/Drizzle (BFF layer, not direct-DB):** The Nuxt app is a BFF proxy — the backend owns data persistence. Removed from all surfaces:
  - Stack listing in SKILL.md, profile-nuxt.md, README.md: `Drizzle/D1` dropped; profile now reads "BFF proxy layer, no D1/KV/R2".
  - `scaffold-nuxt.md`: after cloning `tammai/nuxt-fullstack-template`, a new cleanup step removes Drizzle deps (`drizzle-orm`, `drizzle-kit`), `server/db/`, `drizzle.config.ts`, D1/KV blocks in `wrangler.toml`, and `db:*` scripts from `package.json`. Wrangler itself stays (still needed for Cloudflare Pages deployment).
  - `profile-nuxt.md`: stack header updated.

---

## [1.10.1] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- **nuxt profile — stale SPA-era architecture docs:** Added `[Nuxt] BFF Boundary` section to the generated `architecture.md` addendum (sole backend caller is `server/api/`, token stays server-side, openapi types generated server-side at `server/types/api.d.ts`). Removed "frontend repos" wording from the shared `AI_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` contract item (now "API surface changed" — profile-neutral and correct for the BFF model).

---

## [1.10.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **bigin-harness-setup — Nuxt project scaffolding (nuxt profile):** running setup harness on an empty/non-Nuxt repo now scaffolds the full app, not just governance. New **Phase 0.5** scaffolds in-place from `tammai/nuxt-fullstack-template` (via the `nuxt-fullstack-scaffold` flow: `nuxt.config.ts`, modules, `eslint.config.mjs`, `app/`, `server/`, Drizzle/Wrangler, `simple-git-hooks`), then the harness layer is overlaid additively. New `references/scaffold-nuxt.md`.

### Changed

- **nuxt profile — BFF proxy architecture:** Conventions now document the Nuxt server (`server/api/`) as the sole backend caller. The backend access token lives in the `nuxt-auth-utils` sealed session and never touches the browser. Client-side code calls same-origin `/api/*` only (no auth headers). `openapi.yaml` types are generated server-side (`server/types/api.d.ts`). The old `plugins/api.ts` browser-side Bearer pattern is replaced by a `server/api/` proxy example. CLAUDE.md hard rules updated accordingly.
- **Governance overlay reconciles with the scaffolded template:** when `SCAFFOLDED`, the skill does not overwrite the template's `CLAUDE.md` (appends a pointer) or `.vscode/settings.json` (merges), and **skips `scripts/pre-commit.sh`** when a hook manager (`simple-git-hooks`/`husky`) already gates commits. It adds only the BigIn guardrails the template lacks: `.claude/guards/bash-guard.py`, `.claude/settings.json` (permissions + PreToolUse bash-guard + PostToolUse `pnpm lint --fix`), `AI_TASK_GUIDE.md`, `AI_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`, `.claude/rules/{security,architecture}.md`.
- **nuxt profile relabeled SPA → fullstack (Cloudflare)** across the Phase 0 menu, README, and profile spec, to match what actually gets scaffolded.

---

## [1.9.1] - 2026-06-30

### Changed

- **bigin-harness-setup:** The skill now initializes git and installs the pre-commit hook itself instead of printing the command for the user to run. New Phase 5-1b: ensure a git repo exists (`git init` only if not already one), then symlink `.git/hooks/pre-commit` → `scripts/pre-commit.sh`. Idempotent — never re-inits, and never clobbers a pre-existing foreign hook without confirming. Phase 7 summary and Output Checklist updated; README onboarding step retained for fresh clones (`.git/hooks/` is not version-controlled).
- **nuxt profile — auto-format on every edit (aligned with `nuxt-fullstack-template`):** ESLint via `@nuxt/eslint` is the single formatter, Prettier disabled. The generated `.claude/settings.json` wires a `PostToolUse` hook (`Write|Edit|MultiEdit`) running `pnpm lint --fix` for the agent; a generated `.vscode/settings.json` gives humans the same via ESLint format-on-save. New `conventions.md` formatting section documents the stylistic config (`commaDangle: 'never'`, `braceStyle: '1tbs'`), `eslint.config.mjs` `withNuxt()`, and `lint-staged` (`"*.{ts,vue,js,mjs}": "eslint --fix"`). No custom script.
- **nuxt profile — `nuxt-auth-utils` added to the stack:** session/auth standardized on the module. New Auth section in the generated `conventions.md` (`useUserSession`, `setUserSession`, `requireUserSession`, `hashPassword`/`verifyPassword`, `NUXT_SESSION_PASSWORD`), plus a hard rule in `CLAUDE.md` (auth via `nuxt-auth-utils` only). Stack lines in README and the profile spec updated.

---

## [1.9.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **bigin-harness-setup skill:** New skill that scaffolds a standardized AI workflow harness into any repo — CLAUDE.md, scoped governance rules, enforcement hooks, and per-stack conventions. Supports `nuxt`, `go`, and `nodejs` profiles. Idempotent re-runs are safe.
  - `SKILL.md`: 8-phase workflow (detect profile → detect existing → generate CLAUDE.md + rules + AI files → enforcement → README update → summary)
  - `references/profile-nuxt.md`: Nuxt 4 SPA templates (CLAUDE.md, conventions with centralized `plugins/api.ts` Bearer pattern + openapi-typescript, settings.json)
  - `references/profile-go.md`: Go/Gin templates (CLAUDE.md, conventions with handler pattern + openapi-first, settings.json)
  - `references/profile-nodejs.md`: Node.js TypeScript templates (CLAUDE.md, conventions with Zod boundary validation + openapi-typescript, settings.json)
  - `references/files-shared.md`: Shared templates (security.md, architecture.md, AI_TASK_GUIDE.md with spec gate, AI_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md, optional code-reviewer agent)
  - `references/hook-guard.md`: `bash-guard.py` (blocks `--no-verify` and force-push) + pre-commit scripts per profile

### Changed

- **BREAKING — Plugin and repo renamed `bigin-webapp-harness` → `bigin-skills`.** The plugin is now a collection of skills rather than a single harness factory. Install commands change to `/plugin marketplace add tammai/bigin-skills` and `/plugin install bigin-skills@bigin`. GitHub auto-redirects the old `tammai/bigin-webapp-harness` URL, but existing installs should re-add the marketplace and reinstall under the new name.
  - GitHub repo renamed `tammai/bigin-webapp-harness` → `tammai/bigin-skills`.
  - `plugin.json` / `marketplace.json`: `name` updated to `bigin-skills`; homepage/repository URLs, description, and keywords updated.
  - `README.md` / `CLAUDE.md`: rewritten around the skill collection.

### Removed

- **bigin-webapp-harness skill** (`skills/bigin-webapp-harness/` — SKILL.md + 7 reference files) — the Nuxt/Go agent-team harness factory. Removed in favor of `bigin-harness-setup`. Historical changelog entries below are retained.

---

## [1.8.1] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **README.md:** Backend project type description still said "chi router" — updated to "Gin router" (chi was removed in v1.8.0)
- **fullstack-mvp.md:** Local dev and deploy code blocks used `npm` instead of `pnpm` (`npm install -D` → `pnpm add -D`, `npm run build` → `pnpm build`, `npm run deploy` → `pnpm deploy`)
- **fullstack-mvp.md:** `compatibilityDate` and `wrangler.toml` `compatibility_date` were `2025-01-01` — aligned to `2025-01-15` to match `scaffold.md`; added missing `compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]` to canonical `wrangler.toml`
- **backend-go.md:** Makefile had target `dev` and a `lint` target that do not exist in the scaffold — renamed `dev` → `run` and removed `lint` to match `scaffold.md`
- **SKILL.md + skill-manifest.md:** Aligned skill names (`nuxt` → `nuxt4-patterns`, `vueuse-functions` → `vueuse`, `cloudflare-pages` → `wrangler`); added explicit create-on-not-found fallback (Phase 5-2); renumbered downstream phases (5-2 → 5-3, etc.)
- **Version:** Bumped to `1.8.1`

---

## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-21

### Changed

- **Go backend stack:** Switched the HTTP router from `chi` to **Gin** (`github.com/gin-gonic/gin`) across `references/backend-go.md`, `references/scaffold.md`, and `references/agent-roles.md`
  - `backend-go.md`: rewritten `main.go`, handler, testing sections for Gin (`*gin.Context`, `c.JSON`, `c.Param`); added new sections for **Request binding & validation** (`c.ShouldBindJSON` + `binding:"..."` tags), **Route Registration** (`r.Group("/api/v1")`), and **Middleware Pattern** (`gin.HandlerFunc` + `c.Next()`/`c.AbortWithStatusJSON`)
  - `scaffold.md`: `cmd/server/main.go` now uses `gin.Default()` + `r.Run()`; added `internal/middleware/` to the created-directories list
  - `agent-roles.md`: `backend-dev` stack knowledge updated to Gin (routing, binding, `c.Request.Context()`); `qa` testing note now mentions `gin.SetMode(gin.TestMode)` + `r.ServeHTTP(w, req)`
  - Service/repository layers and project layout are unchanged (framework-agnostic)
- **Version:** Bumped to `1.8.0`

---

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-21

### Removed

- **Skill manifest:** Removed `vue`, `vue-best-practices`, `vue-testing-best-practices`, and `github-actions` from the Phase 5 install list for both Nuxt types (Fullstack MVP and SPA Frontend)
  - Fullstack MVP: 16 → 12 skills (10 base + drizzle optional + nuxt-auth-utils optional)
  - SPA Frontend: 14 → 10 skills (9 base + nuxt-auth-utils optional)

### Changed

- **Session handoff:** Standardized `SESSION.md` location to `.claude/memory/SESSION.md` (project-relative) across `session-handoff/SKILL.md` and `CLAUDE.md` — previously inconsistent (`~/.claude/memory/`, `~/.claude/projects/<project-id>/memory/`)
- **Version:** Bumped to `1.7.0`

### Fixed

- **CHANGELOG.md:** Removed duplicate `[1.6.0]` entry that appeared twice
- **spa-frontend.md:** Added missing `runtimeConfig.public.apiBase` to the canonical `nuxt.config.ts` — the spec referenced `useRuntimeConfig().public.apiBase` without defining it
- **SKILL.md:** Phase 5 summary table was missing `session-handoff` for all project types — added to all three
- **README.md:** Plugin structure diagram listed library skill directories (`nuxt/`, `pinia/`, etc.) that do not exist in this repo — corrected to show only `bigin-webapp-harness/` and `session-handoff/`; renamed "Bundled Skills" heading to "Skills Installed at Harness-Time"

---

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Scaffold refactor:** Nuxt projects (Types 1 & 2) now use `pnpm create nuxt@latest . --template ui --packageManager pnpm --no-gitInit --no-install` instead of manual file writing
- **Scaffold:** `pnpm install` now runs automatically for Nuxt projects — projects are ready to develop immediately after scaffold
- **Scaffold:** Customization prompt now asks for app name, primary color, neutral color, and font before scaffold runs
- **Scaffold:** New config files added to all Nuxt projects:
  - `vitest.config.ts` — Vitest configuration with Nuxt test environment
  - `.vscode/settings.json` — ESLint as default formatter, format on save
  - `.editorconfig` — Consistent editor settings (2 spaces, LF, UTF-8)
- **Scaffold:** Git hooks now added to all Nuxt projects:
  - `simple-git-hooks` — Pre-commit hook for linting
  - `lint-staged` — Run ESLint on staged `.ts`, `.vue`, `.js`, `.mjs` files
- **Scaffold:** New devDependencies for all Nuxt types:
  - `@vitest/coverage-v8` — V8 coverage provider for Vitest
- **Dependencies:** `github-actions` skill added to Phase 5 install list for both Nuxt types (was missing from inline summary)

### Changed

- **Scaffold:** `nuxt.config.ts` template for Fullstack MVP now explicitly includes `ssr: false` (was accidentally removed in refactor)
- **Scaffold:** Step 3 now explicitly states that nuxi-generated files must be overwritten if scaffold.md lists them
- **SKILL.md:** Phase 3.5 rules updated to clarify that nuxi-generated files are replaced, not preserved
- **SKILL.md:** Phase 3.5 now references the "Announce" block in scaffold.md instead of hardcoding a file list
- **SKILL.md:** Phase 0 empty repo message updated to reflect automatic package installation
- **CLAUDE.md:** Added scaffold rules explaining the nuxi init approach, customization prompt, and auto-install
- **Version:** Bumped to `1.6.0`

### Fixed

- **SKILL.md Phase 3.5:** Contradictory rule "Do NOT run pnpm install" — corrected to require auto-install for Nuxt types
- **scaffold.md:** Fullstack MVP `nuxt.config.ts` was missing `ssr: false` — restored to match canonical spec in `fullstack-mvp.md`
- **scaffold.md:** `@vitest/coverage-v8` was missing from devDependencies for both Type 1 and Type 2 — added to both
- **agent-roles.md:** All three QA agent templates (Fullstack, SPA, Go) were missing `agentType: general-purpose` frontmatter — added to all three
- **SKILL.md:** "Never overwrite a file that already exists" rule conflicted with new scaffold approach — clarified that nuxi files must be replaced
- **SKILL.md:** Stale scaffold summary block listed removed files (`.npmrc`) and wrong path (`assets/css` vs `app/assets/css`) — replaced with reference to scaffold.md Announce block
- **SKILL.md:** Phase 5 skills table was missing `github-actions` for both Nuxt types — added to both
- **agent-roles.md:** Type 2 (SPA Frontend) architect role was marked "Recommended" instead of "Always" — changed to `✅ Always` for consistency
- **skill-manifest.md:** Install instructions missing registry qualifier — added `from affaan-m/everything-claude-code` to example
- **scaffold.md:** Added explicit note to substitute `{app-name}` placeholder in `db:migrate` script before writing
- **skill-manifest.md:** Base skill count comment said "12 base" but list actually has 13 — corrected to "13 base"

### Technical Notes

- **nuxi init flags:** Non-interactive mode (no TTY in Claude's bash) requires: `--template ui`, `--packageManager pnpm`, `--no-gitInit`, `--no-install`
- **CSS path:** `~/assets/css/main.css` in nuxt.config.ts is correct — `~` resolves to `app/` in Nuxt
- **Go Backend:** Unchanged by this refactor — still uses file-based scaffold with no package install
- **Coverage:** QA agents enforce 70% V8 coverage threshold — now functional with `@vitest/coverage-v8` installed
- **QA agents:** Now correctly generated with `agentType: general-purpose` so they can run scripts and write test files (Explore is read-only and would break the workflow)
