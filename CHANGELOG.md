and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.10.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **bigin-harness-setup — Nuxt project scaffolding (nuxt profile):** running setup harness on an empty/non-Nuxt repo now scaffolds the full app, not just governance. New **Phase 0.5** scaffolds in-place from `tammai/nuxt-fullstack-template` (via the `nuxt-fullstack-scaffold` flow: `nuxt.config.ts`, modules, `eslint.config.mjs`, `app/`, `server/`, Drizzle/Wrangler, `simple-git-hooks`), then the harness layer is overlaid additively. New `references/scaffold-nuxt.md`.

### Changed

- **nuxt profile — BFF proxy architecture:** Conventions now document the Nuxt server (`server/api/`) as the sole backend caller. The backend access token lives in the `nuxt-auth-utils` sealed session and never touches the browser. Client-side code calls same-origin `/api/*` only (no auth headers). `openapi.yaml` types are generated server-side (`server/types/api.d.ts`). The old `plugins/api.ts` browser-side Bearer pattern is replaced by a `server/api/` proxy example. CLAUDE.md hard rules updated accordingly.
- **Governance overlay reconciles with the scaffolded template:** when `SCAFFOLDED`, the skill does not overwrite the template's `CLAUDE.md` (appends a pointer) or `.vscode/settings.json` (merges), and **skips `scripts/pre-commit.sh`** when a hook manager (`simple-git-hooks`/`husky`) already gates commits. It adds only the BigIn guardrails the template lacks: `.claude/guards/bash-guard.py`, `.claude/settings.json` (permissions + PreToolUse bash-guard + PostToolUse `pnpm lint --fix`), `AI_TASK_GUIDE.md`, `AI_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`, `.claude/rules/{security,architecture}.md`.
- **nuxt profile relabeled SPA → fullstack (Cloudflare)** across the Phase 0 menu, README, and profile spec, to match what actually gets scaffolded.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-06-30

### Changed

- **bigin-harness-setup:** The skill now initializes git and installs the pre-commit hook itself instead of printing the command for the user to run. New Phase 5-1b: ensure a git repo exists (`git init` only if not already one), then symlink `.git/hooks/pre-commit` → `scripts/pre-commit.sh`. Idempotent — never re-inits, and never clobbers a pre-existing foreign hook without confirming. Phase 7 summary and Output Checklist updated; README onboarding step retained for fresh clones (`.git/hooks/` is not version-controlled).
- **nuxt profile — auto-format on every edit (aligned with `nuxt-fullstack-template`):** ESLint via `@nuxt/eslint` is the single formatter, Prettier disabled. The generated `.claude/settings.json` wires a `PostToolUse` hook (`Write|Edit|MultiEdit`) running `pnpm lint --fix` for the agent; a generated `.vscode/settings.json` gives humans the same via ESLint format-on-save. New `conventions.md` formatting section documents the stylistic config (`commaDangle: 'never'`, `braceStyle: '1tbs'`), `eslint.config.mjs` `withNuxt()`, and `lint-staged` (`"*.{ts,vue,js,mjs}": "eslint --fix"`). No custom script.
- **nuxt profile — `nuxt-auth-utils` added to the stack:** session/auth standardized on the module. New Auth section in the generated `conventions.md` (`useUserSession`, `setUserSession`, `requireUserSession`, `hashPassword`/`verifyPassword`, `NUXT_SESSION_PASSWORD`), plus a hard rule in `CLAUDE.md` (auth via `nuxt-auth-utils` only). Stack lines in README and the profile spec updated.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **bigin-harness-setup skill:** New skill that scaffolds a standardized AI workflow harness into any repo — CLAUDE.md, scoped governance rules, enforcement hooks, and per-stack conventions. Supports `nuxt`, `go`, and `nodejs` profiles. Idempotent re-runs are safe.
  - `SKILL.md`: 8-phase workflow (detect profile → detect existing → generate CLAUDE.md + rules + AI files → enforcement → README update → summary)
  - `references/profile-nuxt.md`: Nuxt 4 SPA templates (CLAUDE.md, conventions with centralized `plugins/api.ts` Bearer pattern + openapi-typescript, settings.json)
  - `references/profile-go.md`: Go/Gin templates (CLAUDE.md, conventions with handler pattern + openapi-first, settings.json)
  - `references/profile-nodejs.md`: Node.js TypeScript templates (CLAUDE.md, conventions with Zod boundary validation + openapi-typescript, settings.json)
  - `references/files-shared.md`: Shared templates (security.md, architecture.md, AI_TASK_GUIDE.md with spec gate, AI_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md, optional code-reviewer agent)
  - `references/hook-guard.md`: `bash-guard.py` (blocks `--no-verify` and force-push) + pre-commit scripts per profile

### Changed

- **BREAKING — Plugin and repo renamed `bigin-webapp-harness` → `bigin-skills`.** The plugin is now a collection of skills rather than a single harness factory. Install commands change to `/plugin marketplace add tammai/bigin-skills` and `/plugin install bigin-skills@bigin`. GitHub auto-redirects the old `tammai/bigin-webapp-harness` URL, but existing installs should re-add the marketplace and reinstall under the new name.
  - GitHub repo renamed `tammai/bigin-webapp-harness` → `tammai/bigin-skills`.
  - `plugin.json` / `marketplace.json`: `name` updated to `bigin-skills`; homepage/repository URLs, description, and keywords updated.
  - `README.md` / `CLAUDE.md`: rewritten around the skill collection.

### Removed

- **bigin-webapp-harness skill** (`skills/bigin-webapp-harness/` — SKILL.md + 7 reference files) — the Nuxt/Go agent-team harness factory. Removed in favor of `bigin-harness-setup`. Historical changelog entries below are retained.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **README.md:** Backend project type description still said "chi router" — updated to "Gin router" (chi was removed in v1.8.0)
- **fullstack-mvp.md:** Local dev and deploy code blocks used `npm` instead of `pnpm` (`npm install -D` → `pnpm add -D`, `npm run build` → `pnpm build`, `npm run deploy` → `pnpm deploy`)
- **fullstack-mvp.md:** `compatibilityDate` and `wrangler.toml` `compatibility_date` were `2025-01-01` — aligned to `2025-01-15` to match `scaffold.md`; added missing `compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]` to canonical `wrangler.toml`
- **backend-go.md:** Makefile had target `dev` and a `lint` target that do not exist in the scaffold — renamed `dev` → `run` and removed `lint` to match `scaffold.md`
- **SKILL.md + skill-manifest.md:** Aligned skill names (`nuxt` → `nuxt4-patterns`, `vueuse-functions` → `vueuse`, `cloudflare-pages` → `wrangler`); added explicit create-on-not-found fallback (Phase 5-2); renumbered downstream phases (5-2 → 5-3, etc.)
- **Version:** Bumped to `1.8.1`

---

## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-21

### Changed

- **Go backend stack:** Switched the HTTP router from `chi` to **Gin** (`github.com/gin-gonic/gin`) across `references/backend-go.md`, `references/scaffold.md`, and `references/agent-roles.md`
  - `backend-go.md`: rewritten `main.go`, handler, testing sections for Gin (`*gin.Context`, `c.JSON`, `c.Param`); added new sections for **Request binding & validation** (`c.ShouldBindJSON` + `binding:"..."` tags), **Route Registration** (`r.Group("/api/v1")`), and **Middleware Pattern** (`gin.HandlerFunc` + `c.Next()`/`c.AbortWithStatusJSON`)
  - `scaffold.md`: `cmd/server/main.go` now uses `gin.Default()` + `r.Run()`; added `internal/middleware/` to the created-directories list
  - `agent-roles.md`: `backend-dev` stack knowledge updated to Gin (routing, binding, `c.Request.Context()`); `qa` testing note now mentions `gin.SetMode(gin.TestMode)` + `r.ServeHTTP(w, req)`
  - Service/repository layers and project layout are unchanged (framework-agnostic)
- **Version:** Bumped to `1.8.0`

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-21

### Removed

- **Skill manifest:** Removed `vue`, `vue-best-practices`, `vue-testing-best-practices`, and `github-actions` from the Phase 5 install list for both Nuxt types (Fullstack MVP and SPA Frontend)
  - Fullstack MVP: 16 → 12 skills (10 base + drizzle optional + nuxt-auth-utils optional)
  - SPA Frontend: 14 → 10 skills (9 base + nuxt-auth-utils optional)

### Changed

- **Session handoff:** Standardized `SESSION.md` location to `.claude/memory/SESSION.md` (project-relative) across `session-handoff/SKILL.md` and `CLAUDE.md` — previously inconsistent (`~/.claude/memory/`, `~/.claude/projects/<project-id>/memory/`)
- **Version:** Bumped to `1.7.0`

### Fixed

- **CHANGELOG.md:** Removed duplicate `[1.6.0]` entry that appeared twice
- **spa-frontend.md:** Added missing `runtimeConfig.public.apiBase` to the canonical `nuxt.config.ts` — the spec referenced `useRuntimeConfig().public.apiBase` without defining it
- **SKILL.md:** Phase 5 summary table was missing `session-handoff` for all project types — added to all three
- **README.md:** Plugin structure diagram listed library skill directories (`nuxt/`, `pinia/`, etc.) that do not exist in this repo — corrected to show only `bigin-webapp-harness/` and `session-handoff/`; renamed "Bundled Skills" heading to "Skills Installed at Harness-Time"

---

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Scaffold refactor:** Nuxt projects (Types 1 & 2) now use `pnpm create nuxt@latest . --template ui --packageManager pnpm --no-gitInit --no-install` instead of manual file writing
- **Scaffold:** `pnpm install` now runs automatically for Nuxt projects — projects are ready to develop immediately after scaffold
- **Scaffold:** Customization prompt now asks for app name, primary color, neutral color, and font before scaffold runs
- **Scaffold:** New config files added to all Nuxt projects:
  - `vitest.config.ts` — Vitest configuration with Nuxt test environment
  - `.vscode/settings.json` — ESLint as default formatter, format on save
  - `.editorconfig` — Consistent editor settings (2 spaces, LF, UTF-8)
- **Scaffold:** Git hooks now added to all Nuxt projects:
  - `simple-git-hooks` — Pre-commit hook for linting
  - `lint-staged` — Run ESLint on staged `.ts`, `.vue`, `.js`, `.mjs` files
- **Scaffold:** New devDependencies for all Nuxt types:
  - `@vitest/coverage-v8` — V8 coverage provider for Vitest
- **Dependencies:** `github-actions` skill added to Phase 5 install list for both Nuxt types (was missing from inline summary)

### Changed

- **Scaffold:** `nuxt.config.ts` template for Fullstack MVP now explicitly includes `ssr: false` (was accidentally removed in refactor)
- **Scaffold:** Step 3 now explicitly states that nuxi-generated files must be overwritten if scaffold.md lists them
- **SKILL.md:** Phase 3.5 rules updated to clarify that nuxi-generated files are replaced, not preserved
- **SKILL.md:** Phase 3.5 now references the "Announce" block in scaffold.md instead of hardcoding a file list
- **SKILL.md:** Phase 0 empty repo message updated to reflect automatic package installation
- **CLAUDE.md:** Added scaffold rules explaining the nuxi init approach, customization prompt, and auto-install
- **Version:** Bumped to `1.6.0`

### Fixed

- **SKILL.md Phase 3.5:** Contradictory rule "Do NOT run pnpm install" — corrected to require auto-install for Nuxt types
- **scaffold.md:** Fullstack MVP `nuxt.config.ts` was missing `ssr: false` — restored to match canonical spec in `fullstack-mvp.md`
- **scaffold.md:** `@vitest/coverage-v8` was missing from devDependencies for both Type 1 and Type 2 — added to both
- **agent-roles.md:** All three QA agent templates (Fullstack, SPA, Go) were missing `agentType: general-purpose` frontmatter — added to all three
- **SKILL.md:** "Never overwrite a file that already exists" rule conflicted with new scaffold approach — clarified that nuxi files must be replaced
- **SKILL.md:** Stale scaffold summary block listed removed files (`.npmrc`) and wrong path (`assets/css` vs `app/assets/css`) — replaced with reference to scaffold.md Announce block
- **SKILL.md:** Phase 5 skills table was missing `github-actions` for both Nuxt types — added to both
- **agent-roles.md:** Type 2 (SPA Frontend) architect role was marked "Recommended" instead of "Always" — changed to `✅ Always` for consistency
- **skill-manifest.md:** Install instructions missing registry qualifier — added `from affaan-m/everything-claude-code` to example
- **scaffold.md:** Added explicit note to substitute `{app-name}` placeholder in `db:migrate` script before writing
- **skill-manifest.md:** Base skill count comment said "12 base" but list actually has 13 — corrected to "13 base"

### Technical Notes

- **nuxi init flags:** Non-interactive mode (no TTY in Claude's bash) requires: `--template ui`, `--packageManager pnpm`, `--no-gitInit`, `--no-install`
- **CSS path:** `~/assets/css/main.css` in nuxt.config.ts is correct — `~` resolves to `app/` in Nuxt
- **Go Backend:** Unchanged by this refactor — still uses file-based scaffold with no package install
- **Coverage:** QA agents enforce 70% V8 coverage threshold — now functional with `@vitest/coverage-v8` installed
- **QA agents:** Now correctly generated with `agentType: general-purpose` so they can run scripts and write test files (Explore is read-only and would break the workflow)
