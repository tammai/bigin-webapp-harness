description: "Scaffolds BigIn AI workflow harness into a repo — CLAUDE.md, governance rules, and enforcement gates. MUST use when user says: 'set up harness', 'add AI rules', 'scaffold harness', 'add CLAUDE.md', 'initialize AI workflow', 'set up claude rules', 'thiết lập harness', 'cài harness', 'thêm AI rules', or when onboarding an existing repo for structured AI-assisted development. Supports nuxt, go, nodejs profiles."

# bigin-harness-setup

Sets up a standardized AI workflow harness: governance files, scoped rules, and enforcement gates. Idempotent — re-running on an already-set-up repo is safe.

*Thiết lập harness quy trình AI: tài liệu quản trị, rules theo phạm vi, và cổng kiểm soát. Idempotent — chạy lại trên repo đã cài đặt là an toàn.*

---

## Phase 0: Detect Stack Profile / Phát hiện profile

Check for stack indicators:
1. `nuxt.config.ts` or `nuxt.config.js` → profile = `nuxt`
2. `go.mod` → profile = `go`
3. `package.json` with express/fastify/hono/koa in dependencies → profile = `nodejs`
4. None found or ambiguous → ask:

```
Which stack profile?
1. nuxt   — Nuxt 4 fullstack (Cloudflare Pages): Nuxt UI, Pinia + Colada, VueUse, nuxt-auth-utils, Vitest, Zod — BFF proxy layer, no direct DB access
2. go     — Go REST API backend
3. nodejs — Node.js TypeScript REST API backend

Type 1, 2, or 3.
```

Store result as `PROFILE`. Load `references/profile-{PROFILE}.md` for all template content.

---

## Phase 0.5: Nuxt Project Scaffold / Khởi tạo dự án Nuxt

**nuxt profile only.** If `PROFILE = nuxt` **and** the repo has no `nuxt.config.ts`, the repo isn't a Nuxt project yet — scaffold the full app before installing the harness. Follow `references/scaffold-nuxt.md` (clones `tammai/nuxt-fullstack-template` in place, customizes, installs deps + `simple-git-hooks`).

Set `SCAFFOLDED = true` when this runs (the governance overlay reconciles with what the template already provides — see Phases 1 and 5).

Skip this phase entirely if `nuxt.config.ts` already exists (onboarding an existing repo) or for the `go` / `nodejs` profiles.

---

## Phase 1: Detect Existing Harness / Phát hiện harness hiện có

If `SCAFFOLDED = true`, the template already brought `CLAUDE.md`, `.vscode/settings.json`, eslint config, and a `simple-git-hooks` pre-commit gate. Treat those as pre-existing (do not clobber) and skip straight to adding the BigIn guardrails the template lacks.

Check for existing harness files:
```
CLAUDE.md | AI_TASK_GUIDE.md | AI_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md | .claude/rules/
```

If any exist, show what was found and ask:
```
Found existing harness files: [list them]

Overwrite all? (yes) / Create missing only? (new) / Cancel? (cancel)
```

- `yes` → overwrite all (show what will be replaced before writing)
- `new` → create only files that don't exist; skip existing ones silently
- `cancel` → stop immediately

Store choice as `INSTALL_MODE`.

---

## Phase 2: Generate CLAUDE.md

Read the content from `references/profile-{PROFILE}.md` → `## CLAUDE.md Template` section.

Write to `CLAUDE.md` in the project root.
Skip if `INSTALL_MODE=new` and `CLAUDE.md` already exists.

**If `SCAFFOLDED = true`** (the template shipped its own CLAUDE.md): do **not** overwrite it. Instead append a short pointer block so both coexist:
```markdown
## BigIn AI Guardrails
Task workflow: `AI_TASK_GUIDE.md` · Done = `AI_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` · Rules: `.claude/rules/`
```

---

## Phase 3: Generate .claude/rules/

Create `.claude/rules/` if it doesn't exist.

Generate three files (each: skip if `INSTALL_MODE=new` and already exists):

**conventions.md** — from `references/profile-{PROFILE}.md` → `## conventions.md Template`

**security.md** — from `references/files-shared.md` → `## security.md`

**architecture.md** — from `references/files-shared.md` → `## architecture.md`, then append the profile block from `references/profile-{PROFILE}.md` → `## architecture addendum`

---

## Phase 4: Generate AI Files

**AI_TASK_GUIDE.md** — from `references/files-shared.md` → `## AI_TASK_GUIDE.md`. Write to project root.

**AI_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md** — from `references/files-shared.md` → `## AI_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`. Replace `{COMMANDS}` with the profile's lint/typecheck/test commands (from `references/profile-{PROFILE}.md` → `## Commands`).

Skip each if `INSTALL_MODE=new` and file already exists.

---

## Phase 5: Generate Enforcement / Tạo cơ chế thực thi

### 5-1. Pre-commit hook

**First check for an existing git-hook manager.** If the repo already gates commits via `simple-git-hooks` or `husky` (key in `package.json`), a `.husky/` dir, or an existing `.git/hooks/pre-commit` → **do NOT create `scripts/pre-commit.sh`**. The existing mechanism is the gate; skip to 5-2. (This is the case for `SCAFFOLDED = true` nuxt repos — the template uses `simple-git-hooks` → `pnpm lint-staged`.)

Otherwise (go / nodejs, or a nuxt repo without a hook manager): read `references/hook-guard.md` → `## pre-commit: {PROFILE}`. Write to `scripts/pre-commit.sh`, then `chmod +x scripts/pre-commit.sh`, and continue to 5-1b.

### 5-1b. Initialize git + install the hook

Only when 5-1 created `scripts/pre-commit.sh`. The hook lives in `.git/hooks/`, so a git repo must exist first.

1. **Ensure a git repo.** Check with `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null`.
   - If it fails (not a repo), run `git init` and tell the user a repo was initialized.
   - If it already is a repo, do nothing.

2. **Install the hook** (idempotent — never clobber a foreign hook silently):
   - If `.git/hooks/pre-commit` does not exist, or is already a symlink to `../../scripts/pre-commit.sh` → install/refresh it:
     ```sh
     ln -sf ../../scripts/pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
     ```
   - If `.git/hooks/pre-commit` exists and is **not** our symlink (a real file or a different target) → do NOT overwrite. Show it and ask:
     ```
     A pre-commit hook already exists at .git/hooks/pre-commit.
     Replace it with the harness hook? (yes / no — leave it and I'll note it in the summary)
     ```

3. Confirm to the user that the hook is installed (or was left untouched).

> Note: `.git/hooks/` is not version-controlled, so each fresh clone still needs this step — that's why Phase 6 keeps it in the README onboarding for teammates.

### 5-2. Bash guard (blocks gate bypass)

Read from `references/hook-guard.md` → `## bash-guard.py`. Write to `.claude/guards/bash-guard.py`.

> nuxt auto-format needs no script — it's a `PostToolUse` hook in the nuxt settings.json template that runs `pnpm lint --fix` (the Nuxt ESLint module) after every Write/Edit.

### 5-3. .claude/settings.json

Read the template from `references/profile-{PROFILE}.md` → `## settings.json Template`.

If `.claude/settings.json` already exists:
- **Merge**: add the `hooks` block (for nuxt this includes **both** the `PreToolUse` bash guard and the `PostToolUse` ESLint formatter) and any missing `permissions.allow` entries. Never remove existing entries.
- If the file already has a `hooks` block, merge per-event: append our hook entries without dropping the user's.
- Show the additions before writing.

If it doesn't exist: write fresh.

### 5-3b. .vscode/settings.json (nuxt only)

Editor format-on-save via ESLint. Read `references/profile-nuxt.md` → `## .vscode/settings.json Template`.

- If `.vscode/settings.json` exists: **merge** the keys in (never overwrite; show additions first).
- If not: write fresh.

Other profiles: skip.

### 5-4. Optional: code-reviewer agent

Ask:
```
Add a read-only code-reviewer agent? (yes/no)
```

If yes: read from `references/files-shared.md` → `## code-reviewer agent`. Write to `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`.

---

## Phase 6: Update README / Cập nhật README

Check for `README.md`. If found, check whether it already contains `## AI Onboarding`.

If not present, append the following block (replace `{LINT}`, `{TYPECHECK}`, `{TEST}` with profile commands):

```markdown
## AI Onboarding

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies.
2. Install git hook:
   ```sh
   ln -sf ../../scripts/pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x scripts/pre-commit.sh
   ```
3. Verify gates pass: `{LINT} && {TYPECHECK} && {TEST}`
4. Read `CLAUDE.md` → `AI_TASK_GUIDE.md`.
5. Do one scoped task end-to-end through all gates to confirm the setup works.
```

If no `README.md` exists: skip this phase (do not create one).

---

## Phase 7: Summary / Tóm tắt

Print a short summary of what was created and what's next:

```
BigIn harness setup complete for profile: {PROFILE}

[if SCAFFOLDED] Scaffolded Nuxt app from tammai/nuxt-fullstack-template.

Created:
  AI_TASK_GUIDE.md
  AI_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md
  .claude/rules/security.md
  .claude/rules/architecture.md
  .claude/guards/bash-guard.py
  .claude/settings.json [created/merged]
  CLAUDE.md [created | pointer appended to template's]
  .claude/rules/conventions.md [skipped if scaffolded — see template + profile]
  scripts/pre-commit.sh [skipped if a hook manager already exists]
  [.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md] (if opted in)

Enabled:
  git repo [initialized/already present]
  pre-commit gate [scripts/pre-commit.sh hook | existing simple-git-hooks/husky]

Next steps:
  1. {LINT} && {TYPECHECK} && {TEST}
  2. Read CLAUDE.md + AI_TASK_GUIDE.md
  3. One scoped task through all gates — confirm the harness works.
```

## Idempotency Rules / Tính bền vững

- Check existence before writing every file.
- `INSTALL_MODE=yes` → overwrite. `INSTALL_MODE=new` → skip existing.
- `.claude/settings.json` — always merge (never full overwrite if file exists).
- `README.md` — append only; never overwrite; check for `## AI Onboarding` first.
- `git init` — only if not already a repo (never re-init).
- pre-commit hook — skip if a hook manager (simple-git-hooks/husky) or hook already exists; otherwise install only if absent or already ours, confirming before replacing a foreign hook.
- Nuxt scaffold (Phase 0.5) — only if `PROFILE=nuxt` and no `nuxt.config.ts`; confirm before writing. When `SCAFFOLDED`, do not overwrite the template's `CLAUDE.md` / `.vscode/settings.json` / pre-commit — overlay additively.
- Never delete files not part of the harness.
