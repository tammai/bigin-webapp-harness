Scripts for enforcement gates. Written into the target project during setup.

## bash-guard.py

Write to `.claude/guards/bash-guard.py`.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Blocks Bash commands that bypass quality gates.
Claude Code PreToolUse hook — reads tool input from stdin, exits 2 to block.
"""
import json
import sys
import re

data = json.load(sys.stdin)
command = data.get("tool_input", {}).get("command", "")

BLOCKED = [
    (r"--no-verify", "Error: --no-verify bypasses pre-commit gates. Fix the underlying issue."),
    # -n only in the flag region (a chain of -flags after `commit`), never inside a quoted message
    (r"git\s+commit\s+(?:-\w+\s+)*-n\b", "Error: git commit -n bypasses pre-commit gates. Fix the underlying issue."),
    # --force but NOT --force-with-lease (which is the sanctioned alternative)

for pattern, message in BLOCKED:
    if re.search(pattern, command):
        print(message, file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(2)  # exit 2 = block the tool call in Claude Code
